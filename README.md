# Publish-Subscribe-Broker
Publisher-Subscriber Broker written in C# with the only dependency being [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json).

## To run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Publisher-Subscriber Broker.sln in Visual Studio
3. Build the whole solution by clicking either Build>Build Solution or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+B
4. The EXE files for all three components can be found in (Broker/Publisher/Subscriber)/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1.
5. From here you will be able to launch the broker, as well as any necessary number of publishers and subscribers.

### Alternatively
You can download a release build on the right-hand column. If you already have the .NET framework installed you should download the normal version. If you do not have the framework, or you are unsure if you do, you can download the portable version. Note however that the portable version is signigicantly larger than the normal version.
